          "description": "⚠ Deprecated: To accommodate the monorepo setup, the node version in all templates/demos/examples has changed from 14 to 16. This is not a breaking change as our compile target is still node 14, and node 16 is backward compatible. We still recommend you start using node-version: \"16\" in your .github/workflows/update-feed.yaml today to get the performance/security improvements from the newer node. See example\nChore: Reorganize to monorepo with npm workspace.",

You have hills like Twin Peaks that tower over the city, rugged places like Glen Canyon where you can forget you’re in a city. Running around the Embarcadero in the heat, and running to the ocean via Golden Gate Park, where that last leg of JFK Drive gets chilly because of the sea breeze. Eleva…",
