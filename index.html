                    <span>A few days ago, Simon Willison wrote a great post about PAGNIs, inspired by another post about YAGNI exceptions. I thought both were great, especially the bits about developer tooling. I’ve set up certain parts of tooling for teams multiple times - continuous integration, unit tests, code quality tools, continuous deployment - and every time it has been positive ROI, even counting the tears shed trying to keep front-end continuous-integration tests running.
But it got me thinking about two parts of developer tooling that aren’t widespread and feel like they could be a lot better: one that exists but just isn’t that popular anymore, and the other that doesn’t really exist but I think it should. Here goes.
Nonbinary code quality

                    <span>So I guess the biggest news is that I’m starting to work on Placemark
as a real product and a real company. Back to the world of maps,
to handle some unfinished business: making map data editing good.
It’s been a lot of fun to work on Placemark so far. I’ve written
up some notes on the Placemark blog,
and have been posting teasers on the Placemark Twitter account,
almost daily.

One project I was involved in with consulting has launched:
the Tree Equity Score website
for American Forests,
with Iced Coffee Please.
I think it’s pretty interesting, and it just happened to launch in the middle
of a historic heat wave that is killing people
and exposing how poor places in cities are deprived of funding, planning,
and staffing for urban tree canopy.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

                    <span>I recently released the theme for macwright.com for sale on Ko-fi.
Today I’m adding the /photos section to that theme (something I’ve written about before),
and giving a little background information.
This site’s brutalist design is the result of about a decade of refinement
and tweaking. For specific goals - minimalism, optimization, adaptability,
clarity - I think it has achieved a certain balance.
I get an email about which theme I’m using every month or two. The answer is,
well, this one. I started from a blank HTML page a decade ago, and have
tried to make it better ever since. Better in a few ways:
Clean bill of health from Google Lighthouse: 100 in performance,
accessibility, and SEO.
Real accessibility, based on real feedback from folks with reduced
vision.

                    <span>This was a big month. May 1 feels like eons ago. I’m in a different
place (New York). The
situation with COVID feels dramatically different. Acquired a few new
gray hairs due to the absolute horror which is the logistics of moving
cross-country, especially during a pandemic. We spent a few nervous weeks
waiting for furniture to arrive, and dreading the next interaction with our
absolutely-terrible-no-good moving company. When VCs and some tech company
‘disrupt’ moving by undercutting and technologizing movers, I will make
an exception and cheer them on: this industry deserves to end.
But then, seeing so many old faces, reconnecting, finding a new
favorite restaurant and bar every few days. Visiting family. Feeling some optimism
about the general future.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>

                    <span>I just moved to New York. Three years and nine months ago, I landed in San Francisco. When you leave San Francisco, you’re required to write a Medium post about it, so here’s mine.
San Francisco is a dream to run in. You have hills like Twin Peaks that tower over the city, rugged places like Glen Canyon where you can forget you’re in a city. Running around the Embarcadero in the heat, and running to the ocean via Golden Gate Park, where that last leg of JFK Drive gets chilly because of the sea breeze. Elevation is so unavoidable that some hilly runs start to seem flat, then you visit another city and realize you can run 20 seconds faster a mile when things are actually flat.
When I moved to San Francisco, I moved to the Haight-Ashbury. Realizing the mistake, I lived in the Mission District…</span>

                    <span>Technology is seeing a little return to complexity. Dreamweaver gave way to hand-coding websites, which is now leading into Webflow, which is a lot like Dreamweaver. Evernote give way to minimal Markdown notes, which are now becoming Notion, Coda, or Craft. Visual Studio was “disrupted” by Sublime Text and TextMate, which are now getting replaced by Visual Studio Code. JIRA was replaced by GitHub issues, which is getting outmoded by Linear.
The pendulum swings back and forth, which isn’t a bad thing. Some of the reasons for the last pivot - from complexity to simplicity - have been solved. Webflow fills a need, and produces better output than Dreamweaver did. Notion is more accessible to people who don’t know Markdown. VS Code is very helpful. Excessively helpful. It’s fine.

                    <span>This isn’t a recommendation. It’s more of a habit that I’ve acquired recently. If this makes its way to Hacker News
and people think how could he, my only response will be 🤷, why not.
I’ve been building a thing, in JavaScript, an application sort of like things I’ve built in the past. With the same basic goal of making something useful. How I get to that goal is flexible. But it ends up being a lot of using boring technology, trying not to overthink the easy parts, trying to properly-think the hard parts, and so on. So there’s not that much to write home about that would surprise your usual React/Next.js/JavaScript engineer person.
But one thing that I do think is sort of unusual is: I’m vendoring a lot of stuff.

                    <span>These are some rough thoughts on how to do immutability in programming, to power undo. If you’re looking for an opinionated ‘this is how to do it’ sort of post, I’ve written that about Immutable.js. This is more a publicly-shared scratchpad.
For the fourth or so time in my career, I’m thinking about and implementing an ‘undo’ function. Undo is a powerful feature because it lets people do destructive or major operations without worrying because they can just hit command-z. Implementing undo is a subtle challenge for both UX &amp; algorithms.
I don’t think that my standard approach, in-memory immutability, is the way to go anymore.
In-memory immutability

const myself &#x3D; Immutable.Map({ name: &quot;Tom&quot;, favoriteColor: &quot;red&quot; });
const you &#x3D; myself.set(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;You&quot;);

                    <span>A little late on this one! I’ve been focusing a bit on projects and work, and those days flipped past.
Listening
I’ve been catching up on some back catalogs - Childish Gambino’s 3.15.20 and Beach House’s Depression Cherry.

The little bit of new music is Claud’s spectacular “Super Monster” a hit-packed little indie pop album. (via Rebecca Williams)

Watching


I’m the last person in the world to watch Spinal Tap, but boy is it fun.
Adam Neely continues to make great stuff, like his breakdown of the ‘sea shanty’ trend on TikTok, from a music history perspective.
Reading
I had bad luck with books in February, grinding my way through two that didn’t inspire. But then On Writing from Stephen King, which was excellent, and I’m part-way through Patricia Lockwood’s new book, No One Is Talking about This which is awesome so far. It’s, sure, for the incredibly online.
In my experience, if you’re incredibly online, then books that talk about the Internet, but are written by or for the the occasionally online – are unreadable. They live on the surface, exploring surface level memes like milkshake-duck or Pepe. So you mostly read books that are unrelated to the Internet, so that you don’t read some re-explanation of milkshake-ducking for the fifth time. Anyway, Lockwood lives it, knows the real stuff, and she’s also a fantastically good writer.</span>

                    <span>I have a theory about the future of programming. I doubt I’m the first to have it, but as far as I can tell this isn’t the mainstream thought in the area, and I want to see if this connects for other folks.
There’s this idea about having ‘one way to do things’, that I think is most famous in its phrasing from the Zen of Python
There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
Perl has the opposite motto: There’s more than one way to do it. Whether it’s better to have “one way to do things”, as I’d guess is the dictum of Python and Go, or many ways, like Rust, JavaScript, Lisps, etc, it’s sort of undecided.
But let’s flip the telescope around and peer into the other end.
Programming is about data structures and the ways you manipulate them. There are few languages that can…</span>

                    <span>In the classic 1986 essay, No Silver Bullet, Fred Brooks argued that there is, in some sense, not that much that can be done to improve programmer productivity. His line of reasoning is that programming tasks contain a core of essential/conceptual1 complexity that&#x27;s fundamentally not amenable to attack by any potential advances in technology (such as languages or tooling). He then uses an Ahmdahl&#x27;s law argument, saying that because 1/X of complexity is essential, it&#x27;s impossible to ever get more than a factor of X improvement via technological improvements.
Towards the end of the essay, Brooks claims that at least 1/2 (most) of complexity in programming is essential, bounding the potential improvement remaining for all technological programming innovations combined to, at most, a factor of…</span>

                    <span>Any time you have a benchmark that gets taken seriously, some people will start gaming the benchmark. Some famous examples in computing are the CPU benchmark specfp and video game benchmarks. With specfp, Sun managed to increase its score on 179.art (a sub-benchmark of specfp) by 12x with a compiler tweak that essentially re-wrote the benchmark kernel, which increased the Sun UltraSPARC’s overall specfp score by 20%. At times, GPU vendors have added specialized benchmark-detecting code to their drivers that lowers image quality during benchmarking to produce higher benchmark scores. Of course, gaming the benchmark isn&#x27;t unique to computing and we see people do this in other fields. It’s not surprising that we see this kind of behavior since improving benchmark scores by cheating on benchma…</span>

                    <span>This is an archive of an old pseudonymously written post from the 90s that seems to have disappeared from the internet.
I see that Star Trek: Voyager has added a new character, a Borg.
(From the photos, I also see that they&#x27;re still breeding women for breast size
in the 24th century.) What ticked me off was the producer&#x27;s comment (I&#x27;m
paraphrasing), &quot;The addition of Seven of Nine will give us limitless
story possibilities.&quot;
Uh-huh. Riiiiiight.
Look, they did&#x27;t recognize the stories they had.
I watched the first few episodes of Voyager
and quit when my bullshit meter when off the scale.
(Maybe that&#x27;s not fair, to judge them by only a few episodes.
But it&#x27;s not fair to subject me to crap like the holographic lungs, either.)
For those of you who don&#x27;t watch Star Trek: Voyager,

                    <span>A lot of people seem to think that distributed tracing isn&#x27;t useful, or at least not without extreme effort that isn&#x27;t worth it for companies smaller than FB. For example, here are a couple of public conversations that sound like a number of private conversations I&#x27;ve had. Sure, there&#x27;s value somewhere, but it costs too much to unlock.
I think this overestimates how much work it is to get a lot of value from tracing. At Twitter, Rebecca Isaacs was able to lay out a vision for how to get value from tracing and executed on it (with help from a number other folks, including Jonathan Simms, Yuri Vishnevsky, Ruben Oanta, Dave Rusek, Hamdi Allam, and many others1) such that the work easily paid for itself.

                    <span>We spent one day1 building a system that immediately found a mid 7 figure optimization (which ended up shipping). In the first year, we shipped mid 8 figures per year worth of cost savings as a result. The key feature this system introduces is the ability to query metrics data across all hosts and all services and over any period of time (since inception), so we&#x27;ve called it LongTermMetrics (LTM) internally since I like boring, descriptive, names.
This got started when I was looking for a starter project that would both help me understand the Twitter infra stack and also have some easily quantifiable value. Andy Wilcox suggested looking at JVM survivor space utilization for some large services. If you&#x27;re not familiar with what survivor space is, you can think of it as a configurable, fixed…</span>

I think this is odd because tech companies in that class often have hundreds to thousands of employees. They&#x27;re overwhelmingly likely to be better equipped to write a compelling blog than I am and companies get a lot more value from having a compelling blog than I do.

                    <span>My hobby: opening up McIlroy’s UNIX philosophy on one monitor while reading manpages on the other.
The first of McIlroy&#x27;s dicta is often paraphrased as &quot;do one thing and do it well&quot;, which is shortened from &quot;Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new &#x27;features.&#x27;&quot;
McIlroy&#x27;s example of this dictum is:
Surprising to outsiders is the fact that UNIX compilers produce no listings: printing can be done better and more flexibly by a separate program.
If you open up a manpage for ls on mac, you’ll see that it starts with
ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

That is, the one-letter flags to ls include every lowercase letter except for {jvyz}, 14 uppercase letters, plus @ and 1. That’s 22 + 14 + 2 &#x3D; 38 singl…</span>

                    <span>If you read any personal finance forums late last year, there&#x27;s a decent chance you ran across a question from someone who was desperately trying to lose money before the end of the year. There are a number of ways someone could do this; one commonly suggested scheme was to buy put options that were expected to expire worthless, allowing the buyer to (probably) take a loss.
One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there&#x27;s a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn&#x27;t have been uncommon for an individual going…</span>

                    <span>Reaching 95%-ile isn&#x27;t very impressive because it&#x27;s not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn&#x27;t help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it&#x27;s just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.
Note that when I say 95%-ile, I mean 95%-ile among people who participate, not all people (for many activities, just doing it at all makes you 99%-ile or above across all people). I&#x27;m also not referring to 95%-ile among people who practice regularly. The &quot;one weird trick&quot; is that, for a lot of activities, being something like 10%-ile among people who practice can make you something like 90%-ile or 99%-ile among people who participate.

                    <span>When I ask people at trendy big tech companies why algorithms quizzes are mandatory, the most common answer I get is something like &quot;we have so much scale, we can&#x27;t afford to have someone accidentally write an O(n^2) algorithm and bring the site down&quot;1.  One thing I find funny about this is, even though a decent fraction of the value I&#x27;ve provided for companies has been solving phone-screen level algorithms problems on the job, I can&#x27;t pass algorithms interviews! When I say that, people often think I mean that I fail half my interviews or something. It&#x27;s more than half.
When I wrote a draft blog post of my interview experiences, draft readers panned it as too boring and repetitive because I&#x27;d failed too many interviews. I should summarize my failures as a table because no one&#x27;s going to wa…</span>

                    <span>This is a psuedo-transcript for a talk given at Deconstruct 2019. To make this accessible for people on slow connections as well as people using screen readers, the slides have been replaced by in-line text (the talk has ~120 slides; at an average of 20 kB per slide, that&#x27;s 2.4 MB. If you think that&#x27;s trivial, consider that half of Americans still aren&#x27;t on broadband and the situation is much worse in developing countries.
Let&#x27;s talk about files! Most developers seem to think that files are easy. Just for example, let&#x27;s take a look at the top reddit r/programming comments from when Dropbox announced that they were only going to support ext4 on Linux (the most widely used Linux filesystem).

                    <span>A recurring discussion in Overwatch (as well as other online games) is whether or not women are treated differently from men. If you do a quick search, you can find hundreds of discussions about this, some of which have well over a thousand comments. These discussions tend to go the same way and involve the same debate every time, with the same points being made on both sides. Just for example, these three threads on reddit that spun out of a single post that have a total of 10.4k comments. On one side, you have people saying &quot;sure, women get trash talked, but I&#x27;m a dude and I get trash talked, everyone gets trash talked there&#x27;s no difference&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen this, it can&#x27;t be real&quot;, etc., and on the other side you have people saying things like &quot;when I play with my boyfriend, I get accu…</span>

Subject:Re: PostgreSQL&#x27;s handling of fsync() errors is unsafe and risks data loss at least on XFS
Date:2018-03-28 02:23:46

Hi all
Some time ago I ran into an issue where a user encountered data corruption
after a storage error. PostgreSQL played a part in that corruption by
allowing checkpoint what should&#x27;ve been a fatal error.
TL;DR: Pg should PANIC on fsync() EIO return. Retrying fsync() is not OK at
least on Linux. When fsync() returns success it means &quot;all writes since the
last fsync have hit disk&quot; but we assume it means &quot;all writes…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve had this nagging feeling that the computers I use today feel slower than the computers I used as a kid. As a rule, I don’t trust this kind of feeling because human perception has been shown to be unreliable in empirical studies, so I carried around a high-speed camera and measured the response latency of devices I’ve run into in the past few months. Here are the results:

                    <span>A statement I commonly hear in tech-utopian circles is that some seeming inefficiency can’t actually be inefficient because the market is efficient and inefficiencies will quickly be eliminated. A contentious example of this is the claim that companies can’t be discriminating because the market is too competitive to tolerate discrimination. A less contentious example is that when you see a big company doing something that seems bizarrely inefficient, maybe it’s not inefficient and you just lack the information necessary to understand why the decision was efficient.
Unfortunately, arguments like this are difficult to settle because, even in retrospect, it’s usually not possible to get enough information to determine the precise “value” of a decision. Even in cases where the decision led to …</span>
