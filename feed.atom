Today I’m adding the /photos section to that theme (something I’ve written about before),

This site’s brutalist design is the result of about a decade of refinement
and tweaking. For specific goals - minimalism, optimization, adaptability,
clarity - I think it has achieved a certain balance.
I get an email about which theme I’m using every month or two. The answer is,
well, this one. I started from a blank HTML page a decade ago, and have
tried to make it better ever since. Better in a few ways:

place (New York). The
situation with COVID feels dramatically different. Acquired a few new
gray hairs due to the absolute horror which is the logistics of moving
cross-country, especially during a pandemic. We spent a few nervous weeks
waiting for furniture to arrive, and dreading the next interaction with our
absolutely-terrible-no-good moving company. When VCs and some tech company
‘disrupt’ moving by undercutting and technologizing movers, I will make
an exception and cheer them on: this industry deserves to end.
But then, seeing so many old faces, reconnecting, finding a new
favorite restaurant and bar every few days. Visiting family. Feeling some optimism
about the general future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

San Francisco is a dream to run in. You have hills like Twin Peaks that tower over the city, rugged places like Glen Canyon where you can forget you’re in a city. Running around the Embarcadero in the heat, and running to the ocean via Golden Gate Park, where that last leg of JFK Drive gets chilly because of the sea breeze. Elevation is so unavoidable that some hilly runs start to seem flat, then you visit another city and realize you can run 20 seconds faster a mile when things are actually flat.

Dreamweaver gave way to hand-coding websites, which is now leading into Webflow, which is a lot like Dreamweaver. Evernote give way to minimal Markdown notes, which are now becoming Notion, Coda, or Craft. Visual Studio was “disrupted” by Sublime Text and TextMate, which are now getting replaced by Visual Studio Code. JIRA was replaced by GitHub issues, which is getting outmoded by Linear.
The pendulum swings back and forth, which isn’t a bad thing. Some of the reasons for the last pivot - from complexity to simplicity - have been solved. Webflow fills a need, and produces better output than Dreamweaver did. Notion is more accessible to people who don’t know Markdown. VS Code is very helpful. Excessively helpful. It’s fine.

I’ve been building a thing, in JavaScript, an application sort of like things I’ve built in the past. With the same basic goal of making something useful. How I get to that goal is flexible. But it ends up being a lot of using boring technology, trying not to overthink the easy parts, trying to properly-think the hard parts, and so on. So there’s not that much to write home about that would surprise your usual React/Next.js/JavaScript engineer person.

For the fourth or so time in my career, I’m thinking about and implementing an ‘undo’ function. Undo is a powerful feature because it lets people do destructive or major operations without worrying because they can just hit command-z. Implementing undo is a subtle challenge for both UX & algorithms.
I don’t think that my standard approach, in-memory immutability, is the way to go anymore.

Listening
I’ve been catching up on some back catalogs - Childish Gambino’s 3.15.20 and Beach House’s Depression Cherry.
Depression Cherry by Beach House

The little bit of new music is Claud’s spectacular “Super Monster” a hit-packed little indie pop album. (via Rebecca Williams)
Super Monster by Claud

Watching


I’m the last person in the world to watch Spinal Tap, but boy is it fun.
Adam Neely continues to make great stuff, like his breakdown of the ‘sea shanty’ trend on TikTok, from a music history perspective.
Reading
I had bad luck with books in February, grinding my way through two that didn’t inspire. But then On Writing from Stephen King, which was excellent, and I’m part-way through Patricia Lockwood’s new book, No One Is Talking about This which is awesome so far. It’s, sure, for the incredibly online.
In my experience, if you’re incredibly online, then books that talk about the Internet, but are written by or for the the occasionally online – are unreadable. They live on the surface, exploring surface level memes like milkshake-duck or Pepe. So you mostly read books that are unrelated to the Internet, so that you don’t read some re-explanation of milkshake-ducking for the fifth time. Anyway, Lockwood lives it, knows the real stuff, and she’s also a fantastically good writer.]]></summary>

There’s this idea about having ‘one way to do things’, that I think is most famous in its phrasing from the Zen of Python
There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it.
Perl has the opposite motto: There’s more than one way to do it. Whether it’s better to have “one way to do things”, as I’d guess is the dictum of Python and Go, or many ways, like Rust, JavaScript, Lisps, etc, it’s sort of undecided.
But let’s flip the telescope around and peer into the other end.

We didn’t do competitive analysis against Laravel, Django, or Phoenix. They’re similar, not radically better or worse. There are multiple acceptable solutions to a problem, and this was more a matter of choosing the right kind of solution than pursuing some kind of perfect choice and burning hours and motivation doing the window-shopping.

Avoid weasel words
Wikipedia’s article about weasel words is incredible. In this context I mean words like this:
Data
Process
Run
Do
Setup
These words usually don’t mean anything at all. Any variable could be called data. Any method could be called process. These words don’t inform or differentiate. Most methods and variables that include these names are misnamed. Think hard and figure out what’s better:
A method like processData probably isn’t processing any kind of data. Maybe processCsv?
Is it really just “processing” that CSV. Maybe it’s coercing columns that are strings that should be numbers. Maybe coerceCsvRows?
That’s probably better!

His line of reasoning is that programming tasks contain a core of essential/conceptual1 complexity that's fundamentally not amenable to attack by any potential advances in technology (such as languages or tooling). He then uses an Ahmdahl's law argument, saying that because 1/X of complexity is essential, it's impossible to ever get more than a factor of X improvement via technological improvements.
Towards the end of the essay, Brooks claims that at least 1/2 (most) of complexity in programming is essential, bounding the potential improvement remaining for all technological programming innovations combined to, at most, a factor of…]]></summary>

Some famous examples in computing are the CPU benchmark specfp and video game benchmarks. With specfp, Sun managed to increase its score on 179.art (a sub-benchmark of specfp) by 12x with a compiler tweak that essentially re-wrote the benchmark kernel, which increased the Sun UltraSPARC’s overall specfp score by 20%. At times, GPU vendors have added specialized benchmark-detecting code to their drivers that lowers image quality during benchmarking to produce higher benchmark scores. Of course, gaming the benchmark isn't unique to computing and we see people do this in other fields.
